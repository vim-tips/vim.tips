# vim.tips

A space for sharing [vim](https://www.vim.org/) tips.

### What is vim.tips?

The idea of this space is to share and collect `vim` tips of any type. One of
the goals is to try to archive them in an easy way so that they can be used as a
reference.

### How to contribute ?

The project is using [zola](https://www.getzola.org/), you can fork and the
[repository](https://github.com/vim-tips/vim.tips), add your tip as a post in
the `content`, and preview changes locally:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/vim-tips/vim.tips.git
$ cd vim.tips
$ zola serve

Check your changes in http://127.0.0.1:1111
```

Then, you can share your changes by creating a pull request on the branch
`preview`

After the PR is approved your changes will be available here:
[https://preview.vim.tips](https://preview.vim.tips)
